Coding to me have made me see alot of things differently back when I was just coming out of High School I took a carpentry class and I remember that the most important thing was to follow the blueprint and to always have our tools on deck at all times for the job. Well, I look at coding the same as what structure we are going to build with a plan and how are we going to excuse that plan. From using a hammer to bang a nail into finding a method to help us inspect what in an array. I look at coding to be useful as tools to get the job done.`
