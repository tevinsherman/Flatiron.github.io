Near the end of 2018 I was in a very dark place not knowing whatâ€™s next for me I was tired of waking up and doing the
same thing over and over again. Wake up early,  go to work, go home, repeat. Lying on my bed one day I begin to look up
at the ceiling with my headphones on with the bass hitting my ears like thunder. I begin to shed a tear thinking about what can I do to change the situation and to better myself. I begin looking at YouTube videos of people learning how to code and how they jumpstart their careers. So 2019 begins I start using an all-in-one desktop to learn how to code and from that point, I challenge myself to #100daysofcode. Learning for at least 1 hour every time I get off work and from then on the next 7 months, learning was starting to get addictive. During the process, I even had to buy myself a laptop to able to get more hours in after work so I can learn anywhere. I started to feel better about myself again,  I become a better thinker when it came to problem-solving, and I became more curious about computers and their powers. Deep down I knew that this was it to get me started a career in tech and now I just need to take it one day at a time to get there.
